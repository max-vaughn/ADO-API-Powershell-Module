[Azure-AD-Support-Module GitHub project](https://github.com/ms-willfid/Azure-AD-Support-PowerShell-Module)  
This project adopts the same structure but is tailored to the Azure DevOps APIs.

# Current Status of this project
At the moment, the only thing that will work is importing the psm1 file.  The other items in this project have not been fully attached.  This status will be updated with versioning information once items are tested.

This PowerShell module is intended to help illustrate simple REST concepts using the Azure Dev Ops REST APIs.  Do not assume that the examples of calling APIs in these cmdlets is the recommended method for using these APIs.  This is just one person's interpretation of how the APIs work together and can be used to accomplish a specific tasks.

DO NOT USE this PowerShell module for production and do not have any dependency on any of the cmdlets. Expect breaking changes and no SLA on resolving issues within this PowerShell module.

Cmdlets may change at any time without notice.

Best regards,
Max Vaughn
